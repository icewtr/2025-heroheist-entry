the repo for my CAD and documentation.


# DISCLAIMER: THE ASSEMBLY STEP FILE IS IN THE ZIP. IT HAD TO BE COMPRESSED BECAUSE OF HOW BIG THE FILE WAS.


# Context:
- I am the main cadder for FRC team 1923, and as an exercise for personal imporvement, I participated in WestCoast Products' (an FRC vendor) 2025 cadathon, Hero Heist. 

# What Does this Robot Do?
 It is a robot focused on launching/shooting Dodgeball balls called Speech Bubbles into certain compartments, and dropping large "plates" called story panels into other compartments.
 It does all this while still being insanely short, being barely 16 inches tall, a really short height for an FRC robot.

# Technical Specs at a Glance:
 Swerve Drive Specialties mk5n Omni-Directional Swerve Drivetrain Powered by WestCoast Products Kraken x60 and x44 Brushless motors.
 Ball launcher/Shooter with 4 ball capacity and adjustable angle, powered by WestCoast Products Kraken x60 and REV Robotics NEO Vortex.
 Ball intake using Mecanum wheels to center balls into a small intake, saves a lot of space.
